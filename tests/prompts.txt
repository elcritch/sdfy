## Prompt

Great, now implement a new type in `sdftypes.nim` and implement a new func in `shapes.nim` for the follow GLSL function: 

```
float sdCircle( vec2 p, float r )
{
    return length(p) - r;
}
```

## Prompt

Great, next implement the `sdCircle` function in `shapesSimd.nim` following the patterns established there.
Then add it to the `drawSdfShape`.
You don't need to update the tests1.nim file. Just run `tests1_simd.nim` as it will run the SIMD versions of test1.nim automatically.
